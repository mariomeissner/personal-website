## About me

I am a full stack engineer at Indeed based in Tokyo. I have research and engineering experience with machine learning, especially natural language processing. In 2022 I graduated with a master's degree at the University of Tokyo, where I did research on shortcut debiasing and published several papers on major conferences.

## About this website

This website is the home for my blog and digital garden, and serves as a playground for me to learn new web technologies. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mariomeissner/personal-website).

## What is a digital garden?

A digital garden is an online space where you store your knowledge, thoughts and ideas. Think of it as a published version of your personal notes. In my case, I take notes with Obsidian and pull the markdown files into this website. While some notes are more polished, many are sketches or unfinished thoughts.
