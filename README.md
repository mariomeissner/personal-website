## Mario's Blog & Digital Garden

This is the repository for my website [mariomeissner.dev](https://mariomeissner.dev). Built with Next.js, Tailwind and Contentlayer. Originally bootstrapped by (this template)[https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog] but heavily customized.

Feel free to use as a reference for how to build custom websites that leverage your markdown notes (e.g. from (Obsidian)[https://obsidian.md/]). Please link to my repository if you found it useful in building your own projects!
